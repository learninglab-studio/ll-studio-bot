### notes from the instructor: 
#### 20221101 Consultation Notes: 
Anne said that their flagship journal can support audio and visual examples

* MK asked if they could imagine assigning a 12 minute video essay like Adam Neely might do. MK said we can play a couple of those - open a conversation about what people like and don’t like. Then talk about what would be involved in that, what skills would you need, how could you scaffold this.
    * Anne and said Lee that would be great to include and definitely interesting to people.

* MK brought up Chris and Siriana - interest in grad students turning one chapter of dissertation into an alternative media piece - they are offering something like that in the spring - this might connect to the Adam Neely thing
    * Let’s see if Siriana can come to this workshop (DD can do this) to get to her and her role and talk about the tiny desk event

##### We can report back to them about
Whether siriana can come
What tools we’ll show so they can pass that on to students
Instructions on how to get to the LL


##### Workshop learning goals:
Ways to approach galvanizing students
What grad students can do with their own research 

##### So things we can show during the workshop:
Storymaps
Timeline.js
