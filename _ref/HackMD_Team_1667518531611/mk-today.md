## planning

- workflow
    - use action table more frequently as the central spot to go
    - use project and microproject tables more frequently
    - work table created
    - show-your-work integration
    - print cards up on Monday mornings
    - shoot reports more visible
- av-system
    - cable snake out to truss behind stage
    - also locate an ethernet hub there?
    - connect synology10 directly to machines in control room
        - potentially a second ip for that connection?
- don't get so locked in to next that we fall out of practice with react-router, etc
- [react with d3](https://react-d3-library.github.io/)
- canvas API
-
