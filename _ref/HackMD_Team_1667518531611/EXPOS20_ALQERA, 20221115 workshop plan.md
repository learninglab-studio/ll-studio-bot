### notes from the instructor: 
#### notes from consultation: 
* Visit week of nov 15 - they can explore the capstone options and what they’re interested in and could go into more details about how the LL can support. (MK asked if there’s any way for them to identify cool models they like that they can send us before hand and we can unpack it during the workshop and go into how they could make that). Sheza will ask them to write up what they want do and then share with us
