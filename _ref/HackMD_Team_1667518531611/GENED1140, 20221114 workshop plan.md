### notes from the instructor: 
### 20221103 Consultation Notes: 
Pre-notes from Marlon
We could offer Survey the students so we know
November 16 and 17 (besides 12-1pm) for workshop/hackathons (maybe actually both on the 16th)??

Definitely useful to see the assignment prompt.
They don’t know how many students are interested in video and podcast (elizabeth said probably more interested in these than mapping)
102 students!!!
Psy Auditorium (CGIS South - go downstairs, the big auditorium that is there)

Christine proposed for the 14th - unpacking a bit of the form. And do a paper prototyping activity, thinking about the structure. The follow up workshops will dive into the specific medium. Elizabeth said Mary really liked whatever was done last year.

 We can have sign up sheets that we can take a photo of and send back to Elizabeth. 

Elizabeth has had a few students say they want to use iMovie. Elizabeth said we can just give our own recommendations.

Elizabeth will add a question to the survey about the software students are interested in using

They haven’t discussed doing storyboarding - christine she could float doing that with marlon maybe in the later sessions? (or as the paper prototyping activity)

Each student is meeting with a TF individually about their projects

Accomodations?
One hearing impaired student who has a transcriptionist, speaker can wear a live mic so someone can transcribe. Elizabeth will check on that and see which session he wants to go to. Other accommodations won’t apply (course flexibility, etc.)
