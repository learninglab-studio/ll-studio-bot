### notes from the instructor

The Learning Lab will provide the following in-person support during the Fall 2022 semester:

* Workshop 2, Friday, December 2, 2022
    * A Hackathon to support students in creating their final media project.

Q from Jason: Definitely have a lot of people who are not doing multimedia anything. Is there a way to also make this something interesting for those students as well? Definitely have interes in podcast and film but also these other students. Fun different way for them to think about their projects for a day, inspire them. 



* MK asked is the first session still ok 
* from Jason - yes because they’re learning about different types of approaches and the space. But the second session, would someone who is not doing multimedia still get value? How many students would be needed if they wanted to make it optional?
* MK response - pitch activity could be helpful for anyone. More of a show and tell for **Dec2** maybe? Jason was excited - said every student would need to pitch their capstone projects so working that out/practicing/developing would be good. They haven’t selected dates for the pitches yet but it would be after the first week in december.
    * different forms pitches take, how pitches function
    * micro ted talks
* Jason asked if smaller hackathons could be scheduled in the spring for a smaller group of students who were all interested in the same thing (like podcasts), MK suggested evenings and ordering food.
* From Jason-Ed (or Med) school used to do a thing - Educationmatters series - videos of exceptional students talking about their work.
    *  **If there were some pitches Dec 2 that really stood out, to try and capture in some way would be good for department and program**
    * MK said we’d record the whole session Dec 2nd, the live thing would function as a rought draft and if any were great that they wanted to use live they could. But we could also set aside studio time in January for folks they’d ask to record for use
    * can also set up protocol for them to record themselves, as a sort of self-produced social media type of thing.
        * Jason said a lot of students would really be excited about this.
    * They’re also thinking about building up their own ability to be online and be in space. Get dynamic stuff for instagram. How to get content they might have on tiktok or stuff like that. So Jason is also thinking about opportunities for these things. The other program in their department, don’t have super dynamic stuff but they do have excellent photographs that really goes a long way.
* MK said we could make one session(the first session) about social media and the types of stories that could be told in post form. maybe students would get excited about this
    * snapshots of the program assignment
    * different types of storytelling, including social media
    * We’ll add this to our plans for Sept 9
    * Carol and jason should send us examples of storytelling on social media that they like, if they see any

Jason mentioned receiving a list of equipment. Said not sure they’d have a lot of students who’d want to use film stuff. May have a couple of people who want to do podcasts. MK said email LL@Fas and we’re open to having them store it on the other side of the river. Carol said they can certainly store equipment but the students are also in the yard Tuesdays and Thursdays.



* MK said maybe a microphone, maybe they contact us if they want to borrow video stuff because that’s less likely.

Jason asked about any particular software packages that they should have available to students.


* MK said Garageband and Audacity app.
* Cross platform video/podcast editors - Adobe Premiere (MK suggested Adobe Creative Suite)
* MK asked if there are computer labs they have access to?
    * Jason said he doesn’t know what they have beyond Countway
    * Carol asked what MK is looking for. MK said libraries sometimes have software as well as newer machines if students don’t have a machine to use, and just good to let students know about resources in the beginning of the course.
    * Lamont, Cabot, etc.
